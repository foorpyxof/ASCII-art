# Erynn's terminal ASCII art generator!
## About
This repo contains the source code for my very own terminal ASCII art generator :3  
Everything is written by me, including the libraries! (excluding glibc stuff)

Program requires **one** argument, namely the path to the image file you wish to display in the terminal.

*For now BMP is the only working file format. Others will throw fpx::NotImplementedException.*

## To build source:
Use the Makefile. Executable will be popped right into *./build/ascii.o*
